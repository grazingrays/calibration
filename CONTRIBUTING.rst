How to contribute
-----------------

Thanks for taking some time for this project!

This is not your standard open source software project, but a place for
scientific discussion.

We encourage contributions with different points of view, but we should
work on an agreement when it comes to recommendations.

1. To facilitate this, there are 3 places for collaboration, detailed in
   section `Structure of the
   repository`_.

   a) `The issue tracker (also for non-technical
      things) <https://github.com/grazingrays/calibration/issues>`__
   b) `literature.md <./literature.md>`__ - a place to collect literature
   c) `recommendations.md <./recommendations.md>`__ - a single document
      for recommendations

2. Content over form.

   This is work by and for (typically busy) scientists. If formatting
   work would stop you from adding information, adding it in an
   unstructured way or dumping it in an issue is the way to go.

Structure of the repository
---------------------------

Issues
~~~~~~

Issues are used for discussion on specific questions, possibly leading
to additions or changes to `recommendations.md <./recommendations.md>`__.

-  When commenting, please include the reason(s) for your thinking.
-  Feel free to open new issues for questions you’ve been pondering.
   Issues should be actionable and small.

Collecting information: `literature.md <./literature.md>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the place for quotes and bibliography entries directly related
to the repository topic.

Any member can freely add to this document.

Working on consensus: `recommendations.md <./recommendations.md>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (initially empty) recommendations document should only be changed by
pull request after discussion in an `issue <Issues>`__.

Organization members will be notified of pull requests to change
`recommendations.md <recommendations.md>`__ and given 7 days to get
involved (by the time the pull request is ready to be merged, interested
parties will already have had opportunity to see and comment on the
issue).

Two reviews should be positive to change
`recommendations.md <recommendations.md>`__; this is not technically
enforced but let’s not solve social questions by technical means. Of
course, changes can be reversed as well by the same mechanism.
