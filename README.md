# Calibration

This repository is for discussion and recommendations for instrument
calibration (specifically: incident angle and sample-to-detector
distance).

## Literature

[literature.md (WIP)](literature.md) contains quotes of publications
discussing GISAS calibrations.

## Example: Calibration @MOUSE

To initiate discussion, we used the MOUSE calibration routine(s),
looking at two options:
- the specular reflection from a silicon wafer and
- rings from a silicon wafer spin-coated with silver behenate +
  poly(vinyl butyral)
