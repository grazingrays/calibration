- based on the specular reflection
- measure at six incident angles and 13 distances
- simultaneous linear fit

> This is achieved by triangulation with the incoming X-ray beam. The incident beam is specularly reflected from the sample surface and impinges on the detector at a designated position $$d_{\mathrm{h,spec}}, d_{\mathrm{h,spec}}$$. The vertical spot position $d_{\mathrm{v,spec}}$ is determined for six different incidence angles $\alpha_{\mathrm{i}}$ ranging from 0.15 to 0.65${}^{\circ}$ and at 13 relative detector positions to cover a range of LHH of 1.6 m (Fig. 2). Then, the data are grouped by incidence angle and simultaneously fitted with linear functions that have individual parameters for the slope and a common intersection point $L_{\mathrm{off}}, d_{\mathrm{v,isp}}$.
